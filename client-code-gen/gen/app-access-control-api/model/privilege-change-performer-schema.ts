/**
 * This schema represents the structure of the `change_user_details` JSON field used in fam_privilege_change_audit.  The `change_user_details` field captures information about the user who performed a change, including the `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`. It is used to record the user details at the time of the audit event, ensuring that changes to these details later do not affect the integrity of the audit log.  For regular users, all fields (`username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`) are included. However, when the change is performed by a system account, only the `username` field is present, and it is set to \"system\". The schema includes validation logic to enforce this rule.  Attributes:     username (str): The username of the user performing the change. For system accounts, this is \"system\".     first_name (str, optional): The first name of the user. Not present for system accounts.     last_name (str, optional): The last name of the user. Not present for system accounts.     email (str, optional): The email address of the user. Not present for system accounts.  Validation:     The schema includes a validator to ensure that for system accounts (where `username` is \"system\"),     no other fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `email`) are populated.
